# Library

This project will test me on my understanding of JavaScript objects by creating a simple library application. After this project, I will have improved my understanding of objects and their behaviours.

After completing the project, I can say that it has greatly increased my confidence and ability in JavaScript. There was a lot of DOM manipulation involved in this project which helped me refresh my knowledge. I also learned a few new tricks such as <dialog> and data attributes. In particular, data attributes were interesting because they are essentially variables for html elements and really help connect html and JavaScript. 

In conclusion, this project was done over the span of 2 day in around 7 or so hours(could have been shorter but i am slow and procrasitnated). I have learned a lot and am ready to continue TOP.
